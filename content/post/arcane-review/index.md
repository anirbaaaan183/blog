I am going to give you a hot, yet very agreeable take. Arcane is probably, THE BEST piece 
of media ever conjured by humans, period. It can only be aptly described with one phrase - 
"Absolute Cinema". The animation, the story, the unpredictability and the effing MUSIC! It is 
stuck in my head till date. This also gives me an amazing topic to write on for my first blog! 
Note that I will be fanboy-ing all through this article. I never thought I would ever call a TV 
show life-changing, but here we are.

## Preface
This blog will contain several spoilers ahead and so it is recommended to watch the show 
before reading this. Also I will assume you already know the names of all the characters in 
the show, which just emphasizes this point even more. That being said, I will be helping 
you out by jogging your memory about each character.

## Introduction
Arcane is a 2 season animated series based in the League of Legends universe. League of
Legends is a game made by Riot Games which has its own world and lore. This show expands 
on this existing lore and dives deeper into some well-known characters' origins and also 
displays some important events that occurred in the universe. Over the course of the 
show, several different character and story arcs are explored while keeping the primary 
plot of Vi and Jinx's story at the center stand.

## The Story Line
Oof... Just Oof. The story for this show is straight amazing.
