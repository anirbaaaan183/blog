Hi! I am anirbaaaan. My username for every social is `anirbaaaan183`.

Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet. This, in particular, is my blog. But 
before that, who am I. I do have a portfolio at [anirbaaaan.is-a.dev](https://anirbaaaan183.github.io) 
which goes into more detail about me. But in short, I am a freshman doing my Bacherlor 
in Technology on Computer Science and Engineerging with specialisation in CyberSecurity.

I also am a tech enthusiast with a passion for computers and development. I am 
quite fond of programming and love to create stuff. I have also dipped my toes in 
graphic design, video editing and vfx. I am also passionate about music, which 
has improved my life in more ways than I can explain. I have some experience in 
music production too.

All that being said, you should have a better idea of what to expect from this blog 
now. Thanks for visiting.

Stick around!
Smile :)
